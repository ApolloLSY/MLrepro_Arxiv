For the data of GSE69914, GSE76938, GSE48684, GSE73549, GSE65820, GSE66836, GSE89852, GSE58999, and GSE38240, analyses were conducted integratively. The OneVsAll method was employed, and a logistic regression model was constructed based on the selected seven features to train the 1216 samples involving 12 different cancer types. Remarkably, this logistic regression model achieved a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve with an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.986 in the training set, and 0.979 for the mean score of 5-fold cross-validation.
