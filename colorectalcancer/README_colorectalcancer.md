Differentially methylated markers associated with CRC risk were screened on the training dataset using LASSO selection and stepwise logistic regression analysis. sixteen-CpG panel overlapping between the two methods were selected to calculate a methylation risk score (MRS)

In the article, they set these attributes as a best model to calculate MRS:
MRS=MRS_beta*CG
MRS_beta=(-0.41,0.4332,0.2895,-0.5172,-0.3915,-0.3246,-0.2886,0.2451,-0.5651,0.3615,-0.2445,-0.3951,-0.5089,-0.2504,-0.2357,-0.3607)
CG=(cg06551493,cg01419670,cg16530981,cg12691488,cg17292758,cg16170495,cg11240062,cg21585512,cg24702253,cg17187762,cg05983326,cg06825163,cg11885357,cg08829299,cg07044115)
