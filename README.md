logistic regression based on the selected seven features was used to construct the tumor-normal diagnostic model. OneVsRestClassifier with estimator of logistic regression was employed to train the tumor specific multiclass classifier. They randomly split the full dataset into training and test sets with 4:1 ratio in both tumor-normal diagnostic model and tissue-specific classifier.

>In all lists, correlated features were removed by applying a threshold on the calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficients. For DNA-methylation, a threshold of 0.9 was used

>10 equal folds  random-forest models

>accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and the area under the curve (AUC) were calculated.For final model scores, the metrics were averaged across all folds

>The trained models for the differentiation of PDAC and N exhibited cross-validated AUCs between 0.85 and 0.98, when features of the respective dataset were added consecutively. A predictive model based on DNA-methylation showed the highest AUC value—0.980—with the lowest number of features, namely cg02964172 (gene GCNT2, gene body) and cg17184704 (intergenic, chr. 10: 11727286).

Their other focus are distinguishing between pancreatic cancer and pancreatitis, which has been overlooked.

They calculated the methylation beta score as: b = IntensityMethylated/(IntensityMethylated + IntensityUnmethylated) and converted data points that were not significant above background intensity to NAs.  CpGs having greater than 10% missing values prior to normalization were removed. CpGs with a standard deviation of less than 1% across samples were removed. Linear mixed model analysis of the methylation data was performed with patient as a random effect, and age and ethnicity as fixed effects.The p-values were adjusted using the Benjamini and Hochberg method

our AUC（0.96）is similar to their AUC（0.97）

They model the traits of interest as the outcomes and the CpGs as the predictors and train optimized predictors using penalized regression methods, then apply these predictors to approximately 900 individuals to determine: 

(1) the proportion of variance the DNAm predictors explain in the outcomes;

(2) the extent to which these proportions are independent from the contribution of genetics; 

(3) the accuracy with which the DNAm predictors can identify obese individuals, college-educated individuals, heavy drinkers, high cholesterol levels, and current smokers if provided with a random DNA sample from the population; 

(4) the extent to which they can predict health outcomes, such as mortality, and if they do so independently from the phenotypic measure.

Methylation preparation:
>Filtering for outliers, sex mismatches, non-blood samples, poorly detected probes, and samples was performed(Additional file 4). CpGs with missing values, non-autosomal and non-CpG sites, and any sites not present on the Illumina 450 k array was removed.

LASSO regression in Generation Scotland:
>Penalized regression models were run using the glmnet library in R. Tenfold cross-validation was applied and the mixing parameter (alpha) was set to 1 to apply a LASSO penalty. Coefficients for the model with the lambda value corresponding to the minimum mean cross-validated error were extracted and applied to the corresponding CpGs in an out of sample prediction cohort to create the DNAm predictors.

Prediction analysis in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936:
>Area under the curve (AUC) estimates were estimated for binary categorizations of traits. Ordinal logistic regression was used for the categorical smoking variable (never, ex, current smoker). ROC curves were developed for smoking status, obesity, high/low alcohol consumption, college education and cholesterol variables, and AUC estimates were estimated for binary categorizations of these variables using the pROC library in R.Sex was included as a covariate in all models. Correction for multiple testing was applied using the Bonferroni method.

DNAm predictors classify phenotype extremes
>652 controls and 242 cases for obesity, 745 light-to-moderate drinkers and 150 heavy drinkers, 418 non-smokers and 102 current smokers, 229 and 666 individuals with > 11 and ≤ 11 years of full-time education, 531 and 354 individuals with high and low total cholesterol,  89 and 723 individuals with high and low HDL cholesterol,  637 and 175 individuals with high and low LDL with remnant cholesterol, 307 and 502 with high and low total:HDL cholesterol ratios.

To reduce the number of DNA methylation loci:
first, the correlation was calculated between the 472,822 CpG sites and CHD status. CpG sites were retained if the point bi-serial correlation with CHD was at least 0.1. A total of 138,815 CpG sites remained. 
Subsequently, Pearson correlation between those 138,815 sites was calculated. If the Pearson correlation between two loci was at least 0.8, the loci with a smaller point bi-serial correlation (i.e. less correlated with CHD) was discarded. In the end, 107,799 DNA methylation loci (~23%) remained for model training
 A grid search using GridSearchCV was employed to perform 10-fold cross-validation hyper-parameter tuning (maximum features: auto, minimum samples for each split: 2–10, information gain criterion: entropy or gini, maximum tree depth: 500–2500, number of trees: 10000–30000) of the models.All eight final tuned models were saved for testing on the test dataset where majority voting was used to ensemble the votes of these models.

 ## ~~Alzheimer’s disease predictor~~

**They observe three types of AD diagnosis: cognitive normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia (AD).But they didn't use baseline data to predict disease outcomes; instead, they used four-year, four-timepoint longitudinal data to predict four outcomes: CN-to-CN (n = 147), CN-to-MCI (n = 44), MCI-to-MCI (n = 147), and MCI-to-AD (n = 111).
Maybe not suitable for our research.**

>The MRS (range, − 5.59 to 4.35) was significantly higher for CRC subjects than in healthy normal subjects (P <  0.000), with a median MRS of 1.68 (IQR, 1.43) in CRC subjects and − 0.430 (IQR, 2.89) in healthy normal subjects. The MRS was associated with a 2.68-fold increased risk of CRC (OR = 2.68, 95% CI: 2.13, 3.38, P <  0.0001). The MRS showed a good predictive ability for discriminating between CRC and healthy normal subjects (AUC, 0.85; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.89).

>HumanMethylation450 array, we used the pipeline developed by Touleimat and Tost (21). Individual data points with detection P > 0.01 or number of beads <3 were treated as missing data. Samples with >20% missing probes were treated as missing data. 
linear model was developed.
SVM model is constructed in a similar manner as the linear regression method. For a given CpG site j, we used xij and yij as the training data set to build an SVM model.[their R package](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/liming-liang/cross-tissue-methylation/).

They did not disclose their training data, but they used publicly available GSE data as test data and provided model performance parameters. Therefore, I am currently training on our EWAS data and will also try the GSE public data they used
>In the independent data set of six individuals and 24 LCL T cell pairs, the correlation R2 between predicted value and T cell methylation was 0.95 for both SVM and LM models (average across 144 LCL-T cell pairs) compared with 0.92 for LCL-T cell correlation (Supplementary Figure S17). After removing CpG sites with minimum methylation β values > 0.9 or maximum β values < 0.1 among all subjects in both LCL and T cells, our prediction model increased the overall R2 from 0.88 to 0.92. When the cut-points for minimum and maximum β values were changed to 0.8 and 0.2, respectively, the overall correlation R2 increased from 0.80 to 0.87. The magnitude of improvement was smaller than the cross-validation estimate in our 39 samples (Supplementary Figure S17). This is likely because the target tissue in the training data set is PBLs, whereas the target tissue in testing data set is T cells. The significant improvement, especially for LCL-T cell pairs with lower correlation (Supplementary Figure S17), suggests that the prediction model built in a training data set is applicable to future studies and improves the utility of surrogate tissues.
